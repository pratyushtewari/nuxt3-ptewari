      <h2>Problem Statement</h2>

      <p>
        The legacy VidyoDesktop™ application was a very successful but a
        monolithic application for video-conferencing. This was build in
        <a href="https://www.qt.io/" target="_blank">Qt</a>
        . As Vidyo’s strived to provide better UX and customizable white-labeled
        products to clients, this framework was very time consuming if not
        limiting.
      </p>
      <br />

      <h2>My role</h2>
      <h3>Senior UI/UX Designer and Engineer | Jan 2016 - May 2018</h3>
      <p>
        I led the front-end team for Vidyo Connect. Oversaw daily agile
        processes and built the design language across all products and major
        releases. One such upgrade to an existing deployment received 3.6
        million calls minutes (140% increase) across 42,000 meetings (180%
        increase) with 92,500 (280% increase) calls in first 6 days and has
        grown to become the largest private video conferencing platform in the
        world logging more than 3 Billion minutes of talk time and over 150
        Million conference calls.
      </p>
      <h3>UI/UX Designer and Engineer | October 2014 - Dec 2015</h3>
      <p>
        I designed and developed the UX for Vidyo Connect. Defined the company’s
        new UX strategy and collaborated with a team of designers and engineers
        to upgrade existing products. Created a new web UI framework and
        partnered with the SDK team, and enhanced the existing static video
        platform to a highly customizable unified communication platform.

      <h3>Inception</h3>

      <p>The begining a new kind of video-conferencing.</p>

      <grid class col="2" col-s="1">
        <c span="1">
          <p>
            After extensive research into what our clients needed, the direction
            of the company and the new SDK roadmap that was being developed in
            parallel to the application, I created wirframes for a new kind of
            video conferencing application that was able to take the users into
            a call as fast as possible, provide ample navigation and freedom to
            use the app while the users are still in the call, manage calendar
            and account settings, make application sharing fast and reliable and
            many more.
          </p>
        </c>
        <c span="1">
          <img src="./img/wireframe.png" />
        </c>
      </grid>
      <br />
      <p>
        I created a wireframe application to test my hypotheses about the
        navigation and feature set. Below is a time-lapse of one of such session
        with potential clients.
      </p>

      </div>
      <br />
      <br />
      One on the main selling point about the new thinking was to make a video
      conferencing app entirely on a chrome engine. This was one of the main
      drawbacks of the old product since it was native on all platforms, it was
      very time consuming to make updated and add features to all platform. In
      order to be successful in unified communication it was imperative to
      release all the features on all the platforms, windows, mac, ios, android
      and linux. While our core rendering team was trying to improve the webRTC
      stack and working with chrome team to improve rendering multiple real time
      audio and video feeds and compose them at the end client, my team was
      responsible to create the framework to support all these features and
      develop the application.

            Together with my architect we create a new kind of framework and he

            We investigated popular javascript frameworks like angular, vue and
            react and at that time and found that going in-house with a much
            light-weight javascript framework will be the best course of action.

              Low learning curve for existing javascript developers. No prior
