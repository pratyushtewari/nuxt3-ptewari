          more time trying to figure out what they want to eat. Whether it is
          for themselves, for a group of people, you will find people spending a
          lot of effort trying to learn, understand and experience different
          kinds of food, culture, and variety.

        During my market research, I found that there are three basic types of
        food hunting solutions. Firstly, there are ones that give you a lot of
        options any let you decide where to source your food from. Secondly, the
        ones that help you learn and try out recipes and cook yourself and
        thirdly, the ones that make the decision for you and relieve you from
        all the tension.

          There was a lot of activities that users did
          <strong>at home</strong>
          while thinking about food. From researching about the next travel to
          cooking different meals, to ordering food for a bunch of friends.
          EATLAS should help the users in achieving all these activities.

          While there are many apps that help you pick and filter the
          restaurants that you want to order from or dine-in, but there is a lot
          of
          <strong>time spend on deciding</strong>

          about them. Most of the curiosity came from their conversations with

        The design of the app is very simple and based on three primary

        wants to pursue, they can deep dive into it and either read about the
        country, look into its cuisine and recipes or pick a restaurant to
        either to go or order from. The other side of the app is the admin
        content generators where they will be provided with a good editor tool

        While designing this app, I went through various iterations of design
        and testing to make sure the app is both informative as well as pleasing
        and fun. During this phase, I made a design system with grids,
        typography, colors, and components that can be used over and over and
        overloaded so that the content generation is geared properly to make
        templates that can be coded easily. Below is a glimpse of such
        iterations.
